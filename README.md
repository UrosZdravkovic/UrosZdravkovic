# Hi there, I'm Uros! 👋

**Frontend Developer | Automation Engineer | n8n Enthusiast**

Frontend developer working with React and TypeScript. I got into automation because it felt like the most practical skill I could add—why build an app if the processes around it are still manual? Now I create both the interfaces users see and the workflows running behind the scenes.---

## 🚀 Profile

I've gone from troubleshooting appliances and SEO tools to building the automations that prevent issues before they happen. My customer support background taught me to understand what users actually need-my technical skills let me build it.
Whether it's a React frontend, a Supabase backend, or an n8n workflow that syncs data and sends Slack updates automatically-I love turning "we do this manually every week" into a one-click solution.

## 🏆 Key Strengths & Focus

- **Frontend Development**: Building responsive web apps with React, TypeScript, and modern UI libraries like Tailwind CSS and Radix UI.

- **Workflow Automation**: Designing n8n workflows that connect APIs, sync databases, and eliminate manual processes-turning hours of work into one-click solutions.

- **AI Integration**: Creating AI-powered tools using OpenAI and LangChain nodes in n8n-from Telegram bots that analyze meal photos to agents that route tasks automatically.

- **Backend & Databases**: Working with Supabase and Firebase for authentication, real-time data, and API integrations.
