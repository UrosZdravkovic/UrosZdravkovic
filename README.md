# Hi there, I'm Uros! 👋

**Frontend Developer | Automation Engineer | n8n Enthusiast**

> After years of handling support tickets, I started automating the processes that created them. Now I build workflows that eliminate repetitive work and apps that solve real problems.

## 🚀 Profile

I've worn many hats—starting from customer support, moving into frontend development, and now diving deep into workflow automation. My passion lies in **building tools that save time** and **connecting systems** so teams can focus on what matters most.

Whether it's a React app, a Telegram bot, or an n8n workflow that syncs data across platforms—I love turning manual processes into automated solutions.
