# Hi there, I'm Uros! 👋

**Frontend Developer | React & TypeScript Enthusiast**

Frontend developer focused on building responsive, user-friendly web applications with React and TypeScript. I also enjoy automation and have hands-on experience with n8n-connecting APIs, syncing data, and eliminating manual work when the opportunity arises.

## 🚀 Profile

I've gone from troubleshooting appliances and SEO tools to building web applications that solve real problems. My customer support background taught me to understand what users actually need-my technical skills let me build it.

Whether it's a clean React frontend, a Supabase-powered backend, or a quick automation that saves the team hours every week-I focus on creating solutions that work.
